This manual test illustrates [gh-192](https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/issues/192), a bug in Flocking that causes (at minimum) low sample rate (i.e. < 44.1 KHz) AIFF-encoded audio files to play back at an inappropriately high speed using <code>flock.ugen.playBuffer</code>. This only seems to be an issue when the <code>speed</code> input is set to <code>1.0</code>; a value of, say, <code>0.999999</code> causes the playback to be normal. Converting the AIFF file to WAVE format, even at the same sample rate, also does not exhibit the issue.
